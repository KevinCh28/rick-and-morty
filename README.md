# Rick and Morty Character Wiki

## Architectural decisions
* Seperated components too keep it more organized allowing for easier time if scaling.
* Divide features into seperate reducers with each seperate action creators.
* Mindful of naming conventions.
* File structure relatively flat.

## Testing
* Chrome React Developer Tools
* debugger to confirm state/props

## Future direction
* Add locations and episodes index & show page, making this application a Rick and Morty Wiki vs a character wiki.
* Make a splash page, current splash page is characters index list.
* Styling each character on index page, add image.
* Styling character on show page.

## Credits
* Character images and information sourced from Rick and Morty API.
* Function withRouter code snippet sourced from stack overflow.
